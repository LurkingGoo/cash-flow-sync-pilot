## 💡 AI-Assisted Development Journey (3-4 minutes)

### The Development Approach
"This project showcases the future of software development - AI-human collaboration. Let me share our development journey and key learnings."

#### What AI Excelled At
"Using **Lovable.dev**, we achieved remarkable speed:
- **Complete React components generated in seconds**
- Modern TypeScript interfaces with proper typing
- Responsive layouts with Tailwind CSS
- Consistent UI patterns following best practices

For example, this entire financial context with real-time subscriptions was generated by AI:
```typescript
interface FinancialData {
  totalBalance: number;
  monthlyExpenses: number;
  monthlyBudget: number;
  portfolioValue: number;
  // Real-time subscriptions built in
}
```

#### Where Human Expertise Was Critical
"However, AI couldn't handle everything. We needed manual intervention for:

**Complex Integration Logic**
```typescript
// Date filtering edge cases required manual fixes
const lastDay = new Date(year, month, 0).getDate();
expensesQuery = expensesQuery
  .gte('transaction_date', `${monthToUse}-01`)
  .lte('transaction_date', `${monthToUse}-${lastDay.toString().padStart(2, '0')}`);
```

**Cross-Platform Synchronization**
- Webhook configuration and debugging
- Real-time subscription management
- Error handling for edge cases"

#### The Sweet Spot
"The most effective approach combined:
1. **AI for rapid component generation** - 70% of our codebase
2. **Human architectural decisions** - System design and integration
3. **Collaborative debugging** - Fixing edge cases and optimization
4. **Manual integration** - Complex business logic"

### Development Statistics
"In just **2 weeks**, we created:
- 25+ React components
- 2 backend services (Express + Edge Functions)
- 12+ API endpoints
- 7 database tables
- 4 real-time subscriptions
- Full multi-platform integration"

## 🔧 Technical Challenges & Solutions (3-4 minutes)

### Challenge 1: Real-Time Data Synchronization
"**Problem**: When a user logs an expense via Telegram, how do we ensure the web dashboard updates immediately without page refresh?

**Solution**: Implemented Supabase real-time subscriptions in React Context:
```typescript
const transactionsSubscription = supabase
  .channel('transactions_changes')
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'transactions',
    filter: `user_id=eq.${userId}`,
  }, () => {
    refreshFinancialData(); // Automatic UI updates
  })
  .subscribe();
```

*[Demonstrate by adding expense via Telegram and showing immediate web updates]*

### Challenge 2: Date Filtering Edge Cases
"**Problem**: JavaScript date handling created invalid dates like '2025-07-32', causing 400 errors.

**Solution**: Proper month-end calculation:
```typescript
const year = parseInt(monthToUse.split('-')[0]);
const month = parseInt(monthToUse.split('-')[1]);
const lastDay = new Date(year, month, 0).getDate(); // Correct last day
```

### Challenge 3: Cross-Platform User Linking
"**Problem**: How do we connect a Telegram user to their web account securely?

**Solution**: User linking table with validation:
- Secure token generation for account linking
- Telegram ID mapping to Supabase users
